Staking is a way of earning rewards for holding certain tokens. There are two types of staking available at Aivuxe Platform.

> Fixed staking, and Flexible staking

**Fixed staking** is ideal for long-term users since they provide a considerably higher return on investment, but they can only be used for a certain duration, as the name implies.

{% hint style="info" %}
Fixed staking earnings begin within 24 hours of depositing the tokens. After that, users will be unable to redeem the tokens because it will automatically lock and can only be redeemed for a specific period.
{% endhint %}

**Flexible staking** enables users to withdraw the tokens anytime but with a lesser APR rate.
