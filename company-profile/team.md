"When I was a kid my life is boring not until I discover this awesome online opportunity where you can communicate and play with other people even though you are stranger. I play various games and play some tournaments but that doesn't satisfied me because growing up you need money that's why I started to tackle cryptocurrency to start trading but trading alone is not my forte as a gamer and then I heard about this play to earn system and start playing."
