# Token Vesting Schedule

Since preserving market equilibrium is a difficult task, We developed this concept as a viable solution that will benefit both our community and investors

Seed : 10% Unlocked Before public sale listing, then 10% quarterly

Private : 20% Unlocked Before public sale listing, then 20% quarterly

Liquidity : 25% Unlocked Before public sale listing , Then 10% monthly over 5 months then 5% monthly for another 5 months (all unlocked tokens will be locked for 2 years to the respective LP pair)

Development : 10% unlocked Before public sale listing and 10% quarterly

Team and Reserved : 1 year fully locked then 25% quarterly

We've chosen this method for a variety of reasons. To keep the market pricing stable and to be fair to our private and public sale investors, as well as to safeguard everyone from a market crash.
