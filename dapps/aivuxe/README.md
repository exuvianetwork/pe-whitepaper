# Aivuxe

NFTs first introduced on 2014, but it wasn't until 2021 that this revolutionary technology gained widespread acceptance, startling the art world and other industries. The NFT landscape has changed dramatically in the previous year.

With the growing NFT craze, we're witnessing a significant increase in their use, yet despite their success, most NFTs are essentially collections with no practical purpose, only to be purchased and then sat in their wallet collecting dust. With the advent of Aivuxe, that is about to change.

Aivuxe is our own AMM Protocol with NFT Based Features built inside the Exuvia Network ecosystem that allows users to not only trade but also earn from their NFT assets. Aivuxe believes that NFTs can be utilized for a lot more than just collecting.
